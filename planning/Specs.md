# Specification

Use this file as a starting point to capture the initial specification of what you are trying to build here.
I find that it helps a lot to first "visualise" by planning the CLI here of the commands to be run
to accomplish the goal you have.

What is this tool/lib for?

Who is it for?

Why build this yourself?

## Development practises

-   For the initial development of this tool I will not be doing the following:

    -   Use agile project software (GitHub Projects etc.)
    -   Not use kanban boards etc. like I normally would use, instead just keep a TODO.md
    -   Use feature branches etc. Everything goes in main for now.
    -   Not get carried away.
    -   Not go overboard on unit-testing and trying to reach an absurd level of code coverage. Will there be unit-test, yes.

-   Why?

    -   Simple, I need to be able to just pickup and write code and have minimal friction. Minimal cognitive overload. Just focus.
    -   I have nothing to proof to anybody else and have been following software best practises etc. for over 2 decades now.
    -   With limited time on my hands, it is now time to just crank out the tool that I need.
