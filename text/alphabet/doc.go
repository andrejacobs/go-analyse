// Package alphabet provides support for describing alphabets used in different languages.
// This package considers an alphabet to mean a valid set of unicode runes that can be used in tasks
// like determining n-grams. A letter means a unicode rune and is generally not a number or a
// symbol (e.g @!$ etc.). Language means a set of identifiable writing letters (e.g. EN = English = Latin Alphabet).
